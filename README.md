Hi,

This is my submition to the test. I managed to finish everything except for the sortino ratio, which gave me alot of difficulty as I couldn't work out which rate of return equation to use for the data and I also wasn't sure what to use for MAR in the downside risk/deviation calculation. I experimented with all the different combinations of r and MAR values but none of them produced the correct value stated so I moved on.

Funnily the cinema task is something I have done before, the exact same thing using listchallengs, I expand on it slightly and search bing's data for more movie data as well as using imdb and justwatch for additional data. This project is also on my github if you would like a look.

Thanks

## Welcome to Aequam Capital’s programming test !

### Summary

This test is designed to evaluate your Python programming skills. It should take you about 2-3 hours, although time spent is not an evaluation criterion.

### Instructions

We ask you to:

*   Fork this repository to your own Github account ;
*   Update original files `exercise.py` and `cinema.py` with your solution. Of the original files, only these 2 should be modified but you can add as many additional files / documents as you want in your commit.
*   Reply to your interviewer with a link to your forked repository once you’re done. **Do not create a Pull Request** as this is a public repository.


The folder `data` contains two files : `data/data.csv` contains the _Eurostoxx 50_ total return price history and this is the financial series you should use to test your functions ; `data/output.csv` contains the same series as well as the expected output for the `macd` function you will write in `exercise.py`.

`exercise.py` : contains some functions you have to fill in along with a description of the requested behaviour of the function.

You are not expected to know these ratios / functions and it’s part of the exercise to see how you go about learning & implementing your solution for each function.

`cinema.py` : Build a small program which transforms Data from the internet into a specified format

### Evaluation

You will be evaluated on the following aspects:

*   **Functionality**: your code should produce the expected output without execution error ;
*   **Readability**: your code should be easily readable for standard users. Feel free to comment or add documentation to your code ;
*   **Efficiency**: your code should perform the requested task in an efficient way.

If you unable to complete any of the questions, provide explanations of what issues you encoutered and how you tried to solve it.

Best of luck,

Aequam Capital's research & development team
